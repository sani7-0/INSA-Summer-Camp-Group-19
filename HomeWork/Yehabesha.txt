- What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.

It is the protocol used by browsers and web servers to communicate and exchange data (like HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) over the internet.

Think of it as the language your browser and a website use to talk to each other.

** Versions of HTTP
There are four major versions of HTTP:

 1. HTTP/0.9 (1991) – The very beginning
Very limited: Only supported GET requests

No headers, no status codes, no modern web support

Used for just sending plain text (HTML)

 2. HTTP/1.0 (1996)
Introduced headers (so the server could say what type of file it’s sending)

Introduced status codes (like 200 OK, 404 Not Found)

But each request needed a new connection – slow and inefficient

 3. HTTP/1.1 (1997) – Most widely used until recently
Allows persistent connections (reuses the same connection for multiple requests)

Supports caching, host headers, and chunked transfer

Still sends files one at a time (browser has to wait for each to finish)

Common today, but not ideal for very fast or modern websites.

 4. HTTP/2 (2015)
Binary format instead of text – faster to parse

Multiplexing: can send many files at once over the same connection

Header compression: less data sent

Better performance for modern web apps

Supported by most modern browsers and web servers

 5. HTTP/3 (2022+)
Uses QUIC (a protocol built on UDP instead of TCP)

Faster connection setup, less latency

Better for mobile and unstable networks

Built for speed, security, and reliability

Still rolling out, but many big platforms like Google and Cloudflare already use it.
