# 🎓 EduConnect - Social Media for Students

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many Ethiopian students lack a reliable, distraction-free online space to connect academically, ask questions, and share resources. Traditional platforms are noisy, and educational forums feel outdated. EduConnect solves this by providing a focused, modern, and secure environment tailored to the real academic needs of students.
