1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
   This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the requirements for the EduConnect web-based platform, a student-centric social media platform designed to empower learning, spark collaboration, and share educational victories. The document serves as a guideline for developers, stakeholders, and testers to ensure the platform meets its objectives.
   1.2 Document Conventions
   Headings follow a hierarchical structure (e.g., 1.1, 2.1).
   Requirements are labeled as FR (Functional Requirement) or NFR (Non-Functional Requirement) followed by a unique identifier.
   Markdown syntax is used for formatting.
   1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
   Audience: Project Team Lead (Fetehadin), developers (Yehabesha, Merwa, Fetehadin, Deresani), UI/UX designers (Merwa, Yehabesha), testers, and education stakeholders.
   Suggestions: Review Section 3 for functional requirements first, followed by Section 5 for security and non-functional constraints.

1.4 Project Scope
EduConnect is a web-based platform that bridges the gap between students by providing a modern, focused environment for academic collaboration, resource sharing, and communication. Key features include user authentication, post system, commenting, educational resource sharing, admin announcements, discussion forums, event calendar, and additional features like contests, legacy points, mentorship systems, daily challenges, study groups, analytics, and social interactions. The platform aims to address educational inequality with accessible, scalable technology.
