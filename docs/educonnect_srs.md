## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the requirements for the EduConnect web-based platform â€” a student-centric social media platform designed to empower learning, spark collaboration, and share educational victories.  
It serves as a guideline for developers, stakeholders, and testers to ensure the platform meets its objectives.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
- Headings follow a hierarchical structure (e.g., 1.1, 2.1).  
- Requirements are labeled as **FR** (Functional Requirement) or **NFR** (Non-Functional Requirement) followed by a unique identifier.  
- Markdown syntax is used for formatting.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
- **Audience:**  
  - Project Team Lead (Fetehadin)  
  - Developers (Yehabesha, Merwa, Fetehadin, Deresani)  
  - UI/UX Designers (Merwa, Yehabesha)  
  - Testers and educational stakeholders  
- **Suggestions:** Review [Section 3](#3-system-features) for functional requirements first, then [Section 5](#5-nonfunctional-requirements) for security and non-functional constraints.

### 1.4 Project Scope
EduConnect is a web-based platform that bridges the gap between students by providing a modern, focused environment for academic collaboration, resource sharing, and communication.  
Key features include:
- User authentication  
- Post system  
- Commenting  
- Educational resource sharing  
- Admin announcements  
- Discussion forums  
- Event calendar
