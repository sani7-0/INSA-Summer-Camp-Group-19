              Over view of HTTP and HTTPS:
1.HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is how our browser talks to websites.
When we open a page like http://example.com, you’re basically saying:

“Hey server, can I please see your homepage?”

The server replies with the website data — like HTML, images, and videos.

2.HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.
It encrypts everything between our browser and the website so no one can spy on what we're doing.

It shows a lock icon in our browser

It protects our passwords, messages, and private info

It's required for login forms, payments, and most modern browser features

So instead of just saying:

“Hey server, give me the homepage.”

we're saying:

“Let’s talk privately. No one else can see our conversation.”

3. And when we ask Why the Web Switched from HTTP to HTTPS
The switch happened because HTTP is no longer safe. Hackers could eavesdrop on people using public Wi-Fi or steal data.

Around 2014–2020, big players like Google and Mozilla started pushing HTTPS:

Google gave HTTPS sites a better search ranking

Chrome and Firefox started labeling HTTP sites as “Not Secure”

Free tools like Let’s Encrypt made HTTPS easy for everyone

Now, most of the internet runs on HTTPS — and that’s a good thing.

4.Different HTTP Methods
When your browser talks to a website, it tells the server what kind of action it wants to take.

Here are the main HTTP methods:

-GET – Ask for data (like visiting a page)

-POST – Send new data (like submitting a form)

-PUT – Replace something (like updating a profile)

-PATCH – Edit part of something

-DELETE – Remove something

-OPTIONS – Ask the server what’s allowed

they are  like the verbs of the internet.

5. HTTP Status Codes – What the Server Says Back
Every time we visit a site, the server responds with a code to say what happened:

200 OK – Everything worked

404 Not Found – Page doesn’t exist

500 Server Error – Something broke on their side

403 Forbidden – You’re not allowed in

6. The Versions of HTTP
Just like apps and phones get updates, so does HTTP.

Version	What Changed
HTTP/1.0==>The original, simple version (1 request at a time)
HTTP/1.1==>Added speed, caching, and better reuse of connections
HTTP/2==>Made everything much faster — allows multiple requests at once
HTTP/3==>Built for the modern web — faster, safer, and great for mobile devices
==>Most modern websites now run on HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to give users the fastest possible experience.
